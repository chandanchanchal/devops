Chapter 4 : Modules
Update code dir to use your current workspace

On puppet master

cp -r /etc/puppetlabs/code /workspace/code    
Update config in the server's config file /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/puppetserver.conf

and update

   master-code-dir: /etc/puppetlabs/code
to

    master-code-dir: /workspace/code
(assuming you are using /workspace as your working/developement directory on the puppet master to store the code at )

Restart Puppet Server

service puppetserver restart  
This may take time.

Generating Modules

Change into the directory for production env

cd /workspace/code/environments/production/modules
Using puppet module command, generate the scaffolding for java and tomcat modules

puppet module generate --skip-interview user-java
 
puppet module generate --skip-interview  user-tomcat
Writing classes

file: modules/java/manifests/init.pp

class java {
 
  package { [ 'epel-release', 'java-1.7.0-openjdk'] : 
    ensure => installed,
  }
 
}
Node Definitions - Applying the code

To apply the default class from java module, create a node definition

create file: environments/production/manifests/app.pp

add the node definition

node 'node1' {
 
   include java
 
}
To apply, login to node1 and run puppet agent

ssh devops@node1
 
sudo su
 
puppet agent -t 
 
Try applying puppet agent on Node2 and check what happens

Creating Default block

file: manifests/site.pp

node default {
 
  notify{'checkpoint_1':
  
    message => '
    
        CHECKPOINT_1
        
        DEFAULT BLOCK APPLIED
        Looks like there is no node definition for this host
    
    '
  }
}
Writing the class to install tomcat

file: modules/tomcat/manifests/install.pp

class tomcat::install {
    
    include java
    
    package { [ 'tomcat', 'tomcat-webapps' ]:
      ensure   => installed, 
      require  => Package['epel-release']
    }
 
}
 
 
Add tomcat::install to node definition for node1 which should now look like

node 'node1' {
 
   include java
   include tomcat::install
 
}
Apply on node1 by running puppet agent

[on node1, as root]
 
puppet agent -t 
 
Nano Project

Now that you have learnt how to write a manifest and apply, and have gone through the class naming conventions, you have been tasked to create the following classe with the specifications as give below,

class : tomcat::service resource : service name : tomcat ensure : running enable : true

service resource should have a dependency on install class

apply it to node1 by updating the node definition. Validate by visiting the IP address of the server and port 8081.
Note : Tomcat may take up to 10mins to come up for the first time. This is discussed in details on this page https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp at the Entropy Source section. We are going to apply that fix in the subsequenct sections.

Also bootstrap node2 ( configure it to talk to the master), create a node definition identical to node1, and apply. Validate that the tomcat service is started on port 8082.



Simplify Run List

file: modules/tomcat/manifests/init.pp

class tomcat {
 
  include tomcat::install
  include tomcat::service 
 
}
 
And production/manifests/app.pp

node 'node1' {
 
  include tomcat
  
}
 
 
node 'node2' {
 
   include tomcat
 
}
 
Question : Why are we not including java anymore?

Managing Files

Create file

create directory to hold files : modules/tomcat/files
create a file modules/tomcat/files/tomcat.conf and add the content from https://github.com/chandanchanchal/devops/commit/71d5bec1042bf6d8b679f4d33f5d5e3b33c41749
Create a class tomcat::config to copy this file to destinition

tomcat::config class

class tomcat::config {
 
  file { '/etc/tomcat/tomcat.conf':
    source    => 'puppet:///modules/tomcat/tomcat.conf',
    owner    => 'tomcat', 
    group    => 'tomcat', 
    mode     => '0644',
    notify   => Service['tomcat'] 
  }
 
}
 
Call it from tomcat class (init.pp)

class tomcat {
 
  include tomcat::install
  include tomcat::config
  include tomcat::service 
}
Apply on Node1 and Node2
