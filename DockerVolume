#The -v option in docker run is used to mount volumes into containers, allowing data to persist outside the container's lifecycle.
docker run -v <volume-name or host-path>:<container-path> image
## Types of Volume Mounts
#Named Volumes (Managed by Docker)
  docker volume create mydata
  docker run -v mydata:/app/data myapp
  #Stored under /var/lib/docker/volumes/
  #Easy to back up, restore, and share between containers

#Bind Mounts (Host directory mapped to container):
 docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp
 #Direct access to the host filesystem
 #Useful for development (e.g., editing code on host, seeing changes in container)

#Example: MySQL with a Named Volume
docker run -d --name mysql-db \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql \
  mysql:5.7

#mysql_data is the named volume.
#/var/lib/mysql is where MySQL stores its data.
#Data persists even if the container is removed.

#Why Use Volumes?
Persistence: Data survives container deletion or crashes.
Separation: Keeps container image and data separate.
Sharing: Multiple containers can share data.
Portability: Named volumes are easier to move between environments.
