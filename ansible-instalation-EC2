echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
Using keybased authentication is advised. If you are still at learning stage use password based authentication (Master & Slave)

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# add below line
PasswordAuthentication yes  and comment this one PasswordAuthentication no
# Then restart sshd service with below cmd

service sshd restart
