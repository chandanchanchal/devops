## Validation Notes

1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Most practicals can run on standard hardware
   - Deep learning for time series requires GPU acceleration
   - All software is open-source and freely available

2. **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**:
   - GPU is essential for all but the most basic exercises
   - CUDA compatibility is critical - ensure PyTorch/TensorFlow version matches CUDA version
   - Foundation models and generative AI require significant GPU memory (â‰¥16GB VRAM ideal)
   - Cloud options recommended for resource-intensive tasks if local hardware is insufficient

3. **Lab Environment Considerations**:
   - Local setup provides best experience but highest cost
   - Cloud options provide flexibility but require internet connectivity
   - Hybrid approach balances cost and performance
   - Version control essential for any setup to manage code and collaborate
